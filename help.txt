I am an AI chatbot.  I can have any personality you want me to have.  Each user has their own chat history and personality setting.
.ai <message> or botname: <message> to talk to me.
.x <user> <message> to talk to another user's history for collaboration.
.persona <personality> to change my personality. I can be any personality type, character, inanimate object, place, concept, etc.
.custom <prompt> to use a custom system prompt instead of a persona
.stock to set to stock settings.
.reset to reset to default personality.
